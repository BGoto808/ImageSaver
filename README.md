# Image_Saver ðŸ“©
When sharing pictures, Discord doesn't allow users to download multiple images at a time-- which can be time consuming when dealing with many images. The ImageSaver Discord bot allows users to download multiple images automatically based on timestamp or number of messages. *Currently in development and not released.* Images are read from text-channel and downloaded into user's Downloads folder.
