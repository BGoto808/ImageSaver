# ImageSaver ðŸ“©
When sharing pictures, Discord doesn't allow users to download multiple images at a time-- which can be time consuming when dealing with many images. The ImageSaver Discord bot allows users to download multiple images automatically based on timestamp or number of messages. Currently in development and not released. Images are read from text-channel and downloaded into user's Downloads folder.
